# Manual Implementation of one variable linear regression using Gradient Descent

1. Objective
To implement one-variable linear regression from scratch using NumPy, and train a model to predict
student scores based on study hours.
 
 2. Methodology
 Gradient descent is used to minimize the cost function (MSE).
 Early stopping is implemented by checking if the cost change is below a tolerance threshold.
 The model learns two parameters:
 w: Weight/slope
 b: Bias/intercept

 3. Output
 Iterative logs showing cost reduction
 Final optimized parameters 
 w and b
 Graph of data points and learned regression line
